# Detection-Fire-using-CNN

Description about the dataset:

Data was collected to train a model to distinguish between the images that contain fire (fire images) and regular images (non-fire images). Data is divided into 2 folders, fireimages folder contains 755 outdoor-fire images some of them contains heavy smoke, the other one is non-fireimages which contain 244 nature images (eg: forest, tree, grass, river, people, foggy forest, lake, animal, road, and waterfall).

Objective: To create a classification model that can detect fire in images
